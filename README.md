# container-apps-boilerplate-nw

Plain and simple template for an [App](host/container-app.bicep) hosted in a [Network](network/virtual-network.bicep)-integrated [Container App Environment](host/container-app-env.bicep), exposed through an [Application Gateway](network/app-gateway.bicep). 

Meant to demonstrate the networking basics (AGW via Private Link), any prod-like qualities are skipped for brevity.
